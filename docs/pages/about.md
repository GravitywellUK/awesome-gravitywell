## Gravitywell

While we’ve been around for over 20 years, Gravitywell is a relatively young company when it comes to our people and our mindset. We pride ourselves on being able to punch well above our weight when it comes to projects and aim to stay ahead of the pack in terms of technology and platforms. We’re always keen to explore new ideas and only typically take on clients where we find the work interesting and able to help us progress our knowledge and experience.

### Ethos

We have people from a wide range of backgrounds and disciplines, which is what makes us great. Everyone has an equal voice when it comes to discussing ideas and we always encourage anyone to share their thoughts and opinions - don’t be afraid to speak up!

Everyone is encouraged to manage their own time across projects and keep others informed and up to date. You’re never expected to do everything on your own though - someone is always on hand to field ideas, provide support & training, and pair up on tricky problems.

### Hierarchy

We operate with a relatively flat hierarchy. The majority of the team handle full-stack development, with certain specialities in dev ops, UX, client services etc. The tech team is supported by a smaller group focused on design, client services, marketing, and management.

### Remote-first

While we have dedicated office space, we’re very much focused on remote working. Within reason, you can work wherever you choose so long as you’re available during working hours and the environment is suitable. At the same time, if you’d prefer to work in the shared office space, you’re more than welcome to do so.

### Ideas & interests

We want everyone to have a chance to share their ideas, skills, and interests wherever possible. A great outlet for this is through our content, both video and written. We dedicate time every week to content, whether it’s writing articles, preparing talks, producing videos, or performing R&D to support any of the above.
