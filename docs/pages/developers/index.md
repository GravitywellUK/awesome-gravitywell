Our developers are a community that likes to help out their fellow dev and explore new avenues in the technical world, and you can to.

Explore our articles below to help you either get started on your own path or extend your knowledge with some tips and tricks of our own.

## Getting started

Here are some articles that will help you get started, including some recommendations of tools and software that can help you along the way.

### Which operating system are you using?

Setup can vary depending on the operating system that you are using. Before diving into a generic setup guide, take a look at our operating system specific guides:

- [MacOS X](/developers/getting-started-macos/)
- [Linux](/developers/getting-started-linux/)

Once you are happy with your operating system specific setup, take a look at the [continued setup guide](/developers/getting-started-continued/).

## Software versions

Syncing up your local [software versions](/developers/software-versions/) can help mitigate unforeseen issues during development.
